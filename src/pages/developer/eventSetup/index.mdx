# Introduction

This section will cover the event handling part, which is a fundamental concept of a Discord bot.

## Project Structure

To efficiently handle events in our Discord bot, we'll structure our project in a way that separates different responsibilities. Below is an example project structure focusing on event handling:

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="nsCore" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="configs">
        <FileTree.File name="botConfig.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="metadata.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="constants">
        <FileTree.File name="botConst.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="interfaces">
        <FileTree.File name="Command.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="ExtendedClient.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="events"></FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

## Type of `events`

Discord has various types of events; however, the main three events required to run an app are:

- `ready` event
- `messageCreate` event
- `interactionCreate` event

<Callout type="info">
  You can learn about more events from discord.js
  [events](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/event-handling.html).
</Callout>

Now let's understand these events one by one! So, let's go!
