# Creating the Core

The `index.ts` file is the heart of your bot. It serves as the entry point for your application, initializing and configuring the bot to connect to Discord and start responding to `events` and `commands`.

<Steps>

### Project Structure

Now, inside the `src` directory, add a file named `index.ts`.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Creating `index.ts`

This is the main file, or we can say the core file, of the bot.

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { Client, Collection, GatewayIntentBits } from 'discord.js'
import { ExtendedClient } from './interfaces/ExtendedClient'
import { logBrightPink } from 'nstypocolors'
import config from './configs/botConfig'

import { commandHandler } from './handlers/commandHandler'
import { eventHandlers } from './events/eventIndex'

const client = new Client({
  intents: [
    GatewayIntentBits.Guilds,
    GatewayIntentBits.GuildMessages,
    GatewayIntentBits.MessageContent,
  ],
}) as ExtendedClient

client.slashCommands = new Collection()
client.messageCommands = new Collection()
client.events = new Collection()

commandHandler(client)
eventHandlers(client)

client
  .login(config.BOT_TOKEN)
  .then(() => logBrightPink('Successfully connected all the commands and the bot is online'))
  .catch((err: string) => console.error('Failed to login: ' + err))
```

<Callout>
  Feel free to customize this setup to suit your needs. You can add additional intents,
  configurations, or other settings to enhance the functionality of your bot.
</Callout>

### Verification

Ensure that you have imported everything correctly and that you have defined your `client` properly.

### Run

Now open your terminal and enter:

```bash copy
npm run execute
```

Congratualations, finally your app (bot) is online.

</Steps>
