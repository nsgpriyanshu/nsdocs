# Slash Commands

`Slash` commands, also known as `interaction` commands, are a newer feature introduced by Discord that provide a more streamlined and user-friendly way for users to interact with bots. Unlike message commands, `slash` commands are invoked by typing `/` followed by the command name directly into the chat input box.

<Steps>

### Project Structure

Now that we've already created the `commands` folder, let's add a folder named `slashCommands` inside it. Then, within the `slashCommands` folder, add another folder named `general`. Finally, inside the `general` folder, add `ping.ts`.

<Callout>
  Our slash command structure is organized similarly to message commands, allowing for efficient
  code management and customization.
</Callout>

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="commands" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="slashCommands" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="general" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="ping.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Create Ping Command

Let's create a basic `ping` slash command to demonstrate how slash commands work. This command will respond with "Pong!" when invoked by the user.

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/commands/slashCommands/general/ping.ts"
import { CommandInteraction, EmbedBuilder, SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js'
import { COLORS, EMOJIS } from '../../../constants/botConst'
import { SlashCommand } from '../../../interfaces/Command'

const Ping: SlashCommand = {
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Replies with pong!',
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName('pong').setDescription('Replies with pong!'),
  async executeSlash(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    const pEmbed = new EmbedBuilder()
      .setColor(COLORS.green)
      .setTitle('ping Command')
      .setDescription(`${EMOJIS.success} pong there, I am Ping`)

    await interaction.reply({ embeds: [PingEmbed] })
  },
  userPermissions: ['SendMessages'],
  botPermissions: ['SendMessages'],
  devOnly: false,
}

export default Ping
```

  Slash command with 100% potential is under development this structure is come with 90% potential
  only. We are trying our best to acquire the 10% potential also.
</Callout>

### Slash Command Structure

Here is an example of the structure of a slash command:

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/commands/slashCommands/"
import { CommandInteraction, EmbedBuilder, SlashCommandBuilder } from 'discord.js'
import { COLORS, EMOJIS } from '../../../constants/botConst'
import { SlashCommand } from '../../../interfaces/Command'

const string: SlashCommand = {
  name: string,
  description: string',
  data: new SlashCommandBuilder().setName(string).setDescription(string),
  async executeSlash(interaction: CommandInteraction) {
    const stringEmbed = new EmbedBuilder()
      .setColor(COLORS.name)
      .setTitle(string)
      .setDescription(string)

    await interaction.reply({ embeds: [string] })
  },
  userPermissions: [''],
  botPermissions: [''],
  devOnly: false/true,
}

export default string
```

<Callout type="warning">
  We did not include any type of `developer` commands in `Slash Commands`. However, our command
  handler and `event` handler are well-structured and capable of handling both regular and
  `developer` commands. If you want to include a `developer` command in `Slash Commands`, you simply
  need to set the `devOnly` property to `true`. There's no need to add anything extra because our
  handlers are perfectly equipped to handle it.
</Callout>

</Steps>

Alright! Go go ahead.
