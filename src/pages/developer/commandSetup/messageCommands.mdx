# Message Commands

`Message` commands are traditional commands in Discord bots that users type directly into the chat. These commands are typically prefixed with a specific character (like `!`, `?`, or any custom prefix you choose). When the bot detects a message starting with this prefix, it processes the command and executes the corresponding function.` Message` commands are straightforward and easy to use, making them a popular choice for many bot functionalities.

<Steps>

### Project Structure

First, create a folder named commands inside the src folder. Then, inside the commands folder, create another folder named messageCommands. Inside this messageCommands folder, create a folder named general. Finally, inside the general folder, add a file named `ping.ts`

<Callout>
  Our message command structure is organized into subdirectories, allowing for better code
  management and customization.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="commands" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="messageCommands" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.Folder name="general" defaultOpen>
          <FileTree.File name="ping.ts" />
        </FileTree.Folder>
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Create Ping Command

Let's create a basic `ping` command to demonstrate how message commands work. This command will respond with "Pong!" when a user types `!ping`.

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/commands/messageCommands/general/hello.ts"
import { EmbedBuilder, Message } from 'discord.js'
import { COLORS, EMOJIS } from '../../../constants/botConst'
import { MessageCommand } from '../../../interfaces/Command'

const ping: MessageCommand = {
  name: 'ping',
  description: 'Replies with Ping!',
  async executeMessage(message: Message) {
    const pingEmbed = new EmbedBuilder()
      .setColor(COLORS.green)
      .setTitle('ping Command')
      .setDescription(`${EMOJIS.success} Ping pong ping`)

    await message.channel.send({ embeds: [pingEmbed] })
  },
  userPermissions: ['SendMessages'],
  botPermissions: ['SendMessages'],
  devOnly: false,
}

export default ping
```

<Callout type="error">
  For example purposes, I have used this `!` prefix. However, in reality, this configuration comes
  into effect whenever the `prefix` is enabled. Remember, we have already set up our `prefix` inside
  the [`messageCreate`](/developer/eventSetup/messageCreate.mdx) event file inside the `events`
  folder, so now all these components are interconnected. We have imported constants from the
  `constants` folder and interfaces from the `interfaces` folder. Ensure that all the imports are
  correct and properly configured.
</Callout>

### Message Command Structure

Now here are the example of the command structure make sure all of your message command will follow this structure.

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/commands/messageCommands/"
import { EmbedBuilder, Message } from 'discord.js'
import { COLORS, EMOJIS } from '../../../constants/botConst'
import { MessageCommand } from '../../../interfaces/Command'

const string: MessageCommand = {
  name: string,
  description: string,
  async executeMessage(message: Message) {
    const stringEmbed = new EmbedBuilder()
      .setColor(COLORS.name)
      .setTitle(string)
      .setDescription(string)

    await message.channel.send({ embeds: [string] })
  },
  userPermissions: [''],
  botPermissions: [''],
  devOnly: false / true,
}

export default string
```

<Callout type="info">
  Now, in the blank spaces, you can add whatever you want. Feel free to modify this command
  structure to suit your needs.
</Callout>

### Developer Command

The Developer Command is a type of command that is restricted to developers only. To enable a command as a Developer Command, you simply need to set the `devOnly` property to `true`.

</Steps>

Alright, now let's go further!
