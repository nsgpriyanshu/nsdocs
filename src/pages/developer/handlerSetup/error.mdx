# Error Handler

An `error` handler in a Discord bot is essential for managing and responding to errors that occur during the bot's operation. This includes handling exceptions that may arise from command execution, API calls, or other unexpected events. An effective `error` handler helps in maintaining the stability and reliability of the bot by gracefully managing errors and providing useful feedback to users and developers.

<Steps>

### Project Structure

Add `errorHandler.ts` inside the `handlers` folder.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="handlers" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.File name="commandHandler.ts" />
      <FileTree.File name="errorHandler.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Create `errorHandler.ts`

This file will contain the logic of the `error handler`, ensuring that any errors encountered during the bot's execution are properly managed and logged.

<Callout type="warning">Docs for this part is under construction.</Callout>
