# Command Interface

The `Command Interface` is a structure that defines how commands should be organized and managed within your Discord bot. By creating a command interface, you ensure that each command follows a consistent format, making it easier to manage and execute commands. This can include defining properties like the command name, description, execute function, and any required permissions.

<Steps>

### Project Structure

As you know we already have created the `interfaces` folder so now just add `Command.ts` inside the `interfaces` folder.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="nsCore" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="interfaces">
        <FileTree.File name="Command.ts" />
        <FileTree.File name="ExtendedClient.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
</FileTree>

### Create `CommandInterface.ts`

  Defining a command interface helps ensure consistency and ease of management for all commands.
</Callout>

```ts copy showLineNumbers filename="src/interfaces/Command.ts"
import {
  ChatInputCommandInteraction,
  Message,
  PermissionResolvable,
  SlashCommandSubcommandsOnlyBuilder,
} from 'discord.js'
import { SlashCommandBuilder } from '@discordjs/builders'
import { ExtendedClient } from './ExtendedClient'

export interface SlashCommand {
  name: string
  description?: string
  data:
    | SlashCommandBuilder
    | Omit<SlashCommandBuilder, 'addSubcommand' | 'addSubcommandGroup'>
    | SlashCommandSubcommandsOnlyBuilder
  executeSlash: (interaction: ChatInputCommandInteraction, client: ExtendedClient) => Promise<void>
  userPermissions?: PermissionResolvable[]
  botPermissions?: PermissionResolvable[]
  devOnly?: boolean
}

export interface MessageCommand {
  name: string
  description?: string
  executeMessage: (message: Message, args: string[], client: ExtendedClient) => Promise<void>
  userPermissions?: PermissionResolvable[]
  botPermissions?: PermissionResolvable[]
  devOnly?: boolean
}

export interface Command extends SlashCommand, MessageCommand {}
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure that all commands adhere to the defined interface for smooth operation.
</Callout>

</Steps>

Alright, now let's move ahead!
