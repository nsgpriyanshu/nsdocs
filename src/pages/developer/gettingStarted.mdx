# Getting Started

Lets dive into the ocean of discord app development.

## Installation

To install Node.js, visit the official [ Node.js ](https://nodejs.org/) website and download the installer for your operating system. Follow the installation instructions provided by the installer.

Once Node.js is installed, you'll have access to [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), which is used to install packages and manage dependencies for your Node.js projects.

## Initiating a Project Folder

To initiate a new project folder, open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, run the following command:

```bash copy
mkdir nscore
cd nscore
```

<Callout type="warning">
  I am not including the steps to create a Discord app (bot) or setting up Node.js. If you are
  unfamiliar with these processes, please refer to the [Discord.js
  documentation](https://discordjs.guide/preparations/setting-up-a-bot-application.html#creating-your-bot).
</Callout>

## Installation

Now, let's install [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/), which is a powerful library for interacting with the Discord API.

```bash copy
npm install discord.js
```

This command will download and install Discord.js and all its dependencies into your project folder. Once the installation is complete, you're ready to start building your Discord bot using Discord.js!

All set! Now we are ready to go further!
