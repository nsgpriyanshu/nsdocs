# Getting Started

So, we've mostly completed all our work outside the `src` directory. Now it's time to enter the `src` directory, where things will get a bit more complex. It's better to begin with the blueprint of the project structure!

## Project Structure

Here is the basic project structure that nsCore will look like:

```bash
nsCore/
├── node_modules/
├── src/
├── .env
├── .eslintrc
├── .eslintignore
├── .prettierrc
├── .prettierignore
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── tsconfig.json
```

Now we have to create each folder and component separately, so let's begin!
