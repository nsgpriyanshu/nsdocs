# Contributing to Our Project

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our project! We welcome contributions from everyone, whether it's fixing bugs, improving documentation, or enhancing the codebase. This document outlines our guidelines and best practices for contributing.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Issues

1. **Identify the Issue**: Search through the existing issues to see if your problem has already been reported. If it has, please add a comment to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

2. **Create a New Issue**: If you have identified a new issue, create a new one with a clear and concise title and description. Be sure to include steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior. Screenshots and logs are helpful.

### Suggesting Enhancements

1. **Discuss First**: Before you start working on a new feature or enhancement, please open an issue to discuss your idea. This helps us understand the proposal and ensures it aligns with the projectâ€™s goals.

2. **Provide Details**: When suggesting enhancements, provide detailed descriptions, use cases, and examples. This helps us understand the value and feasibility of the change.

### Submitting Code Changes

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for each significant change. Use descriptive names, such as `feature/feature-name` or `bugfix/bug-description`.

3. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes following the project's coding style and guidelines. Ensure your code is well-documented and tested.

4. **Run Tests**: Run the existing tests to ensure your changes do not break any functionality. Add new tests for any new features or bug fixes.

5. **Commit Your Changes**: Commit your changes with clear, concise commit messages. Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for commit messages.

6. **Push Your Branch**: Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub.

7. **Create a Pull Request**: Open a pull request (PR) against the `main` branch of the upstream repository. Provide a clear description of your changes, including why they are necessary and any relevant issue numbers.

## Code Style and Guidelines

- **Code Style**: Follow the project's code style and formatting. Use tools like Prettier or ESLint to enforce code style.

- **Documentation**: Update documentation as needed. Ensure all new features and changes are documented.

- **Testing**: Write and run tests for your changes. Ensure your tests cover new features and edge cases.

## Reviewing and Merging Pull Requests

- **Review Process**: Pull requests will be reviewed by maintainers. Be open to feedback and willing to make necessary changes.

- **Approval**: Once approved, your changes will be merged into the `main` branch. You will be notified of the merge.

## Additional Guidelines

- **Code of Conduct**: Please follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all contributors to adhere to these guidelines.
